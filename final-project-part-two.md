# Wireframes / storyboards
> Using your sketches developed last week, further develop your story outline and relevant components visually through the use of wireframing / storyboards. Using your outline as a guide, include high-fidelity, individual draft data visualizations of the critical elements of your story you want to share with your reader. Note: you can build these elements out directly in Shorthand this week if you wish.  Reminder: this template is intended to help, but it doesn't substitute for reading through the full homework assignment!  The assignment page on Canvas includes many important details for completing Part II of the final project. 

## The Untold Story of Food Insecurity Among College Students 
From National Trends to Pennsylvania-Based Solutions

Understanding the Crisis
According to the United States Department of Agriculture, Food Insecurity is defined as a lack of access to enough food needed for an active healthy lifestyle. Food insecurity is considered to be one of the main critical public health issues as it oftentimes leads to a number of negative health and social outcomes.

Serious disparities that exist in our own communities are not always visible, but hunger exists in every state and every county in the USA. It could affect our neighbors, classmates, and others around us.

Every year, 13.5% of households in the United States experience food insecurity, which equates to approximately 47 million people, including 14 million children.

Among those facing food insecurity, 8.4% (11.2 million households) experience low food security, while 5.1% (6.8 million households) suffer from very low food security.

Households with incomes below the poverty line and single-mother households have the highest rates of food insecurity.

In Pennsylvania, 1,538,100 people are facing hunger, including 436,250 children. This means:

1 in 8 people face hunger
1 in 6 children face hunger

This level of food insecurity is more than double the rate for US adults, 12%.

This leads to a discussion of the issue of understanding food pantries and other food assistance programs available for students.
Students experiencing food insecurity often lack awareness about available food resources.
Only 30% of students knew where to find a local food pantry. 
Only 31% of students visited one.
75% said they would use a food pantry if one was available.

Two main reasons why students would not use the food pantry are:
-	Many felt their need was not severe enough compared to others
-	Stigma associated with using pantry

## Proposed Solutions
The majority of students who participated in the survey reported having enough food to eat in terms of quantity but not quality.

Food pantries could considerably help struggling students by offering fresh, nutrient-rich foods instead of less nutritious, inexpensive food options that students can afford on their own. 

Partnering with local farmer markets could increase supply of fresh produce for food pantries. Farmers could donate excess produce, reducing food waste.

University food pantries should also work to increase awareness about their mission, i.e. through social media, email, apps.
