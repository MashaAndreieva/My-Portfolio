## Debt Dynamics: Debt-to-GDP Ratios of OECD Countries, 1995-2010

The multiple-bar chart above illustrates the debt-to-GDP ratio for various countries over time, with a time interval of 5 years. Overall, many countries experienced an increase in their debt-to-GDP ratio from 1995 to 2010. The data is also organized in descending order of debt-to-GDP ratio in the year 2010, which allows for easy comparison and identification of countries with the highest and lowest debt levels.

We can observe that Belgium, Canada, the USA, Italy, and Greece consistently show high debt-to-GDP ratios compared to other countries, with Japan's numbers rising significantly between 2005 and 2015. Additionally, some countries had a zero debt-to-GDP ratio in 1995, including Turkey, Mexico, Israel, Ireland, Colombia, Iceland, Chile, and Switzerland. In other words, these countries had no outstanding debt during that period. However, the situation changed by 2000, with the ratio increasing for Ireland and Switzerland.
