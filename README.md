 My name is Maria, and I'm 24 years old :smiley: . I was born and raised in Ukraine :ukraine: . I'm currently a second-year Master's student of Public Policy at Carnegie Mellon University. Before that, I earned my undergraduate degree from a business school in France :school: . After graduating, I moved to London to work in a fintech company for about two years. This summer, I completed an internship as a Tech Policy Intern at a nonpartisan advocacy group in Washington D.C. 
 
 Here are some of the things I was doing as part of my internship:
 * Monitored privacy-related legislation and regulation, developed policy recommendations.
 * Led a cross-chapter initiative to strengthen local media landscape in the US.
 * Drafted advocacy documents supporting public interest positions on privacy-related issues.
    
 Here are the languages I speak:
 * English
 * Russian

 I relocated to the United States a year ago and currently reside in Pittsburgh :earth_americas: .
