# About me 
 My name is Masha. I'm currently a second-year Master's student of Public Policy at Carnegie Mellon University. This summer, I completed an internship as a Tech Policy Intern in Washington D.C. 
    
 I relocated to the United States a year ago and currently reside in Pittsburgh :earth_americas: .

# What I hope to learn
+ Gain an understanding of data visualization principles.
+ Create a publicly accessible portfolio that demonstrates knowledge gained during the course.
+ Learn how to critique data visualizations and how to justify my suggestions/feedback.
  
I'm currently seeking positions at consulting firms that specialize in providing advisory services to government entities and businesses.
