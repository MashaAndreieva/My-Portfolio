# Changes made since Part II

As I was heading to my part-time job interview near Residence on Fifth, I passed a food pantry which reminded me of a personal experience I had there. It made me realize that addressing food insecurity on college campuses would resonate more with me and the audience for my presentation in class. 

In Part 1 my original topic was “Electric Vehicle Adoption Rates and Charging Infrastructure Development in Rural vs. Urban Areas in Pennsylvania”. However I decided to switch to “Food Insecurity Among College Students” because it allowed me to improve the narrative flow between sections and create a cohesive story.

Here is how the narrative unfolds: 

1 - General Overview of Food Insecurity in the USA: Introduces the broad situation and defines food insecurity.

2 - Food Insecurity Among College Students in the USA: narrows down to the student population, showing statistics and trends.

3 – Focus on Pennsylvania, specifically the Pittsburgh area.

4 - Impact on Academic Performance: highlights the correlation between food insecurity and student academic achievements.

5 - Overview of Public Assistance Programs: addresses the fact that although millions of students are eligible for food assistance benefits, fewer than half apply. The reasons for this include: lack of awareness and complex application processes for food assistance. 

6 - Call to action for State Agencies, Universities and Students. 

I also mentioned successful examples from other universities, such as collaborations with tech non-profits like San Francisco & Marin Food Bank and Code for America NGO. Additionally, I have included data sources to support my findings. 
Through interviews with CMU pantry users and students, many highlighted that while they appreciate the pantry’s existence, they’d benefit more from having fresher, higher-quality food.  Currently even the fresh produce is not very fresh. 

Moreover, many students, especially international ones, are unaware of the food pantry’s services, which once again highlights the need to raise awareness which is one of my key calls to action.

## The audience

My final data story identifies universities, state agencies, and students as the primary audience. 

The interviews I conducted, particularly with CMU students, were instrumental in narrowing my focus. Through interviews with CMU pantry users and students, many highlighted that while they appreciate the pantry’s existence, they’d benefit more from having fresher, higher-quality food.  Currently even the fresh produce is not very fresh. I made specific adjustments to the presentation to tailor it to the right audience. For example, after hearing about students’ experiences, I included a section on the importance of food quality ("expanding food pantries") and how improving this aspect can enhance the pantry's effectiveness.


## Final design decisions

I created a map of the USA using Tableau to show varying levels of food insecurity across different states. Additionally, I designed a chart titled "Food Insecurity Rates Across Campuses in Pennsylvania" on Tableau, which highlights information specific to the Pittsburgh area, including data related to CMU. I also created several bar charts that illustrate the impact of food insecurity on academic performance as well as its distribution among different ethnic groups. Lastly, I visualized the use of public assistance programs with a bar chart, which highlights the low utilization rates by the students who need these programs the most.
