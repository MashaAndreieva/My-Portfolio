Title: "Electric Vehicle Adoption Rates and Charging Infrastructure Development in Rural vs. Urban Areas in Pennsylvania"
 

The transportation sector is the largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) in the USA, surpassing other industrial activities and even outweighing the combined emissions from commercial, agricultural and residential sectors. 

EVs present a promising solution for a significant reduction in GHG emissions. However, this strategy is only effective when reproduced on a mass scale. 

Over the past decade, both federal and state governments, including Pennsylvania, have been providing significant financial incentives to promote transition to EVs adoption. However despite these efforts, the adoption of electric vehicles is relatively far from mass market penetration. 

Several factors contribute to the slower than anticipated rate of EV adoption in PA: 

-	Affordability

Despite the decreasing costs of electric vehicles, the purchase price of EVs still remains higher than other conventional vehicles.

- Improper charging infrastructure
 
 Potential buyers are reluctant to purchase EVs as they are aware of insufficient charging infrastructure.

-	Lack of Public Awareness about the benefits brought by EVs
  

My project aims to explore the differences in EV adoption rates and charging infrastructure development in rural and urban areas in PA. 

My project will highlight the importance of EVs in terms of additional opportunities for economic development, public health improvements, brining more opportunities to rural areas of the state, creating more educational opportunities, etc. 

By presenting my story I aim to provide Pennsylvania policymakers with the information needed to make informed policy decisions related to EV adoption as well as funding allocations. I will also present projections of economic and environmental impacts. 

 The story can also be useful for the general public, especially those who still remain skeptical about the benefits of transitioning to EVs as transportation mode.

# The data

For this project, I plan to use data from official government sources, such as U.S. Department of Energy's Alternative Fuels Data Center, Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, US Energy Information Administration, etc. I will use this information to create charts that will allow us to compare the differences in EV adoption rates in rural vs. urban areas in Pennsylvania. I might use some information from the US Census Bureau to provide some context for the comparisons. 



                                                                                                                               
Name#1: Gasoline Fuel Consumption in Pennsylvania         
URL#1: https://afdc.energy.gov/states/pa
Description#1: This data allows us to understand the current transportation energy use in Pennsylvania. It can also be helpful when calculating current greenhouse emissions produced by the transportation sector in the state. It can also be used to see trends over time which could be compared to EV adoption rates. This would help demonstrate the pace of transition. 

Name#2:Electricity Sources and Vehicle Emissions
URL#2:https://afdc.energy.gov/vehicles/electric-emissions
Description#2: This data containing annual emissions per vehicle type (all-electric, plug-in hybrid, hybrid, and gasoline) allows for a direct impact comparison. It demonstrates the environmental benefits of EVs compared to other traditional gasoline vehicles.


Name#3: Pennsylvania Energy Consumption Estimates, 2022

Description#3: Shows Pennsylvania's current energy landscape

# Method and medium


For my final project, I plan to use Tableau to create a series of data visualizations. I will use raw data from publicly available datasets, for example, the U.S. Department of Energy's Alternative Fuels Data Center, Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, and Department of Environmental Protection, an official Pennsylvania Government Website.
I will also use Shorthand to compile my Tableau visualizations into an engaging story that highlights the opportunities and potential impact of EV adoption in Pennsylvania.
