Title: "Electric Vehicle Adoption Rates and Charging Infrastructure Development in Rural vs. Urban Areas in Pennsylvania"
 

The transportation sector is the largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) in the USA, surpassing other industrial activities and even outweighing the combined emissions from commercial, agricultural and residential sectors. 

EVs present a promising solution for a significant reduction in GHG emissions. However, this strategy is only effective when reproduced on a mass scale. 

Over the past decade, both federal and state governments, including Pennsylvania, have been providing significant financial incentives to promote transition to EVs adoption. However despite these efforts, the adoption of electric vehicles is relatively far from mass market penetration. 

Several factors contribute to the slower than anticipated rate of EV adoption in PA: 

-	Affordability
Despite the decreasing costs of electric vehicles, the purchase price of EVs still remains higher than other conventional vehicles.

-	Lack of proper charging infrastructure
Potential buyers are reluctant to purchase EVs as they are aware of insufficient charging infrastructure.

-	Lack of Public Awareness about benefits brought by EVs
People simply might not be aware of the economic and environmental benefits of switching to EVs.


My project aims to explore the differences in EV adoption rates and charging infrastructure development in rural and urban areas in PA. 

My project will highlight the importance of EVs in terms of additional opportunities for economic development, public health improvements, brining more opportunities to rural areas of the state, creating more educational opportunities, etc. 

By presenting my story I aim to provide Pennsylvania policymakers with the information needed to make informed policy decisions related to EV adoption as well as funding allocations. I will also present projections of economic and environmental impacts. 

 The story can also be useful for the general public, especially those who still remain skeptical about the benefits of transitioning to EVs as transportation mode.
